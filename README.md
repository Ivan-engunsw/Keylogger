# Keylogger
A keylogger that records the input of a user in an attempt to grab more details about their personal information.

# Description
 A functional keylogger that successfully records the inputs of a user to track the data that they put into websites, applications, etc. The keylogger will also be able to extract the content in the clipboard so that it can still grab the data if the user decides to copy and paste the words. Furthermore, the keylogger should not be visibly seen as running to the user. It should be hidden in the background without the user noticing that it is running. Moreover, the keylogger will also capturing screenshots/videos of the user's screen without notifying the user. All of these captured data will be sent to me via email/uploaded somewhere that I can access.
